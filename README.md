## üë®‚Äçüî¨ About Me

I'm a scientist and technical leader passionate about applying computational and statistical tools to advance marine and environmental research. As Branch Chief at NCCOS, I bridge the worlds of bioinformatics, statistical modeling, and environmental science to tackle complex challenges in marine ecosystems.

With a strong background in Python, C++, and cloud computing, my work focuses on leveraging machine learning, image analysis, advanced statistics, and Bayesian modeling to support conservation, fisheries management, and ecosystem health.
